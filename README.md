CacheSim - A simulation of a read-only cache and a read-write data cache.
- Instruction cache: This supports both direct-mapped(set-associative, or fully-associative) as well as non-direct-mapped (random or LRU replacement)
- Data cache: This supports Write-through (write-around or write-allocate) and Write-Back (write-allocate)
